Graphical Stock Exchange

The aim of this project was to create a graphical interface in the form of a web app for an open-source financial exchange simulation called [BSE](https://github.com/davecliff/BristolStockExchange) – a programme developed in 2012 by Prof D Cliff of Bristol University Computer Science Department. 

The original python was manually translated into P5.js to enable integration with a purpose built GUI featuring customisable input options and interactive animated graphs to display data output.
